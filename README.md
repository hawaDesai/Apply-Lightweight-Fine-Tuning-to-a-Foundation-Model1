# Cognizant AI Externship Project: Apply-Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-to-a-Foundation-Model1

## Project Title: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face PEFT

### Project Description:
In this project, I focused on lightweight fine-tuning, an essential technique for adapting foundation models to specific tasks without the need for heavy computational resources. Using the Hugging Face peft library, I implemented parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to customize a pre-trained model for a new application.

### Specifically, I:
- Loaded and evaluated a pre-trained model, assessing its baseline performance.
- Applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning to modify the model by updating only a small subset of its parameters, significantly reducing the memory and compute requirements.
- Performed inference with both the original and fine-tuned models, and compared their performance to evaluate the improvements gained through fine-tuning.
- Through this project, I gained practical experience with the complete PyTorch and Hugging Face workflow for model training and deployment, deepening my understanding of modern, resource-efficient machine learning techniques.

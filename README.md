# Cognizant AI Externship Project: Apply-Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-to-a-Foundation-Model1

## Project Title: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face PEFT

### Project Description:
In this project, I focused on lightweight fine-tuning to modify a foundational model. Using the Hugging Face peft library, I implemented parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to customize a pre-trained model.

### Specifically, I:
- I first loaded and evaluated a pre-trained model, then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning to modify the model 
- Performed inference with both the original and fine-tuned models, and compared their performance to evaluate the improvements gained through fine-tuning.

Through this project, I gained practical experience with the complete PyTorch and Hugging Face workflow for model training and deployment, deepening my understanding of modern, resource-efficient machine learning techniques.
